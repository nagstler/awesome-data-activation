## Adding to this list

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make sure the list is useful before submitting. That implies it has enough content and every item has a good succinct description.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[Resource Name](link) - Description.`
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- The body of your commit message should contain a link to the resource.

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.

## Criteria for accepting submissions

To be included in this awesome list, the resource should meet the following criteria:

1. **Relevance**: The resource must be directly related to Data Activation, ETL, Reverse ETL, or closely associated technologies.

2. **Quality**: The resource should provide valuable information, tools, or insights. It should be well-maintained if it's a software tool or platform.

3. **Uniqueness**: The resource should offer something not already covered by existing entries in the list.

4. **Accessibility**: The resource should be accessible to the community. While some commercial tools are acceptable, there should be a balance with open-source and freely available resources.

5. **Currency**: The resource should be current and relevant to modern Data Activation practices. Outdated resources may be removed over time.

6. **Description**: Each entry must include a concise yet informative description that gives users a clear idea of what the resource offers.

Thank you for your suggestions!

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of an awesome list will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-list guidelines.
